Object Tracking
This repository implements a real-time object tracking. Here we use an algorithm called Yolov3. Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. We can feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order for a real-time object tracker to be created.
